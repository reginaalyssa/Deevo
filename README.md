# Deevo
A personal daily devotion web application that lets you reflect on a verse from the Bible.

The following are the choices of Bible versions as made available by [scrollmapper's Bible Database]:
- American Standard-ASV1901 (ASV)
- Bible in Basic English (BBE)
- Darby English Bible (DARBY)
- King James Version (KJV)
- Webster's Bible (WBT)
- World English Bible (WEB)
- Young's Literal Translation (YLT)

Deevo makes use of Django as its web framework and is currently still being developed. This web app serves as my final project for Harvard's [CS50] course.
