# Deevo
A personal daily devotion web application that lets you reflect on (a) Bible verse(s) or a quotation of your own. It has features such as verse suggestions, [typeahead.js] form fields, and a variety of Bible versions to choose from.

The following are the choices of Bible versions as made available by [scrollmapper's Bible Database]:
- American Standard-ASV1901 (ASV)
- Bible in Basic English (BBE)
- Darby English Bible (DARBY)
- King James Version (KJV)
- Webster's Bible (WBT)
- World English Bible (WEB)
- Young's Literal Translation (YLT)

Deevo makes use of Flask as its microweb framework, SQLAlchemy as its database toolkit, and Heroku as its cloud platform. This web app was made as my final project for Harvard's [CS50] course.
